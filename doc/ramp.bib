@book{McMSch02,
	abstract = {This is a book about abstract regular polytopes, published as volume 92 of the Cambridge University Press series Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications. The book definitely satisfies the guidelines of the series. It covers its subject comprehensively, provides a thorough exposition of applications and connections with other areas and serves as a valuable and authoritative encyclopedic reference. The book is organized into fourteen chapters and has $551+ 13$ pages and $470$ references. The introductory chapter provides an enlightening historical account about "Platonic" bodies and their higher-dimensional analogues. Moreover, it lays a foundation for a general theory by introducing and reviewing important concepts like convex regular polytopes, face lattices, Schl{\"a}fli symbols, Coxeter groups, regular maps, etc. Here the reader meets for the first time the important guiding principle that a geometric structure $S$ (polytope, tessellation, abstract poset) is regular if the associated group of symmetries $G(S)$ acts transitively on the set of all flags (maximal chains) in $ S$. In the subsequent chapter the authors introduce "abstract polytopes" essentially as (pure, connected) posets with the property that for every two incident faces $F<G$ of ranks $i-1$ and $i+1$ respectively, there exist precisely two $i$-faces $H$ such that $F< H <G$. Regular abstract polytopes, as the main objects of study of the book, are also introduced in this chapter as the abstract polytopes with flag transitive automorphism groups. The emphasis on the associated group of symmetries, apparent throughout the book, is reflected by whole chapters and sections devoted to various classes of groups associated to abstract regular polytopes. For example, Section 2E gives a characterization of the so-called $C$-groups, the groups that arise as the groups of symmetries of abstract regular polytopes, Chapter 3 is an overview of Coxeter groups, Chapter 9 covers the theory of unitary reflection groups, Chapter 6 is about space-forms and associated groups, Chapter 13 covers abstract regular polytopes associated to linear groups, etc. However, the authors skilfully demonstrate that much of the beauty and charm of the subject lies in the preservation of the geometric flavor of the subject. This is reflected in the geometric intuition and basic constructions with these objects which often extend similar operations with classical regular polytopes. For example, the amalgamation of abstract regular polytopes, presented in Chapter 4, is an extension of a basic intuition that regular polytopes can inductively be built from regular polytopes of smaller dimension. Other important general techniques for constructing new regular polytopes from old ones (mixing and twisting) are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapters 10 and 11 are devoted to the problem of classifying abstract regular polytopes which are locally toroidal (a challenging problem of B. Gr{\"u}nbaum), with the main results in the rank $4$ case, while Chapter 12 deals with toroidal polytopes of higher rank. This monograph is a valuable addition to the literature, being the first comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject and its ramifications since the publication of H. S. M. Coxeter's \ref[ Regular polytopes, Methuen, London, 1948; 1949; MR0027148 (10,261e)] and \ref[ Regular complex polytopes, Cambridge Univ. Press, London, 1974; MR0370328 (51 \#6555)].
