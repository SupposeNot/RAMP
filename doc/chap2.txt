  [33X[0;0YSome quick notes on installation:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRAMP is confirmed to work with version 4.11.1 of GAP, but is known not
        to work with some earlier versions.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YCopy the RAMP folder and its contents to your GAP [10X/pkg[110X folder.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YIf  using  the  GAP.app  on  macOS,  this  should  be  your user
              [10XLibrary/Preferences/GAP/pkg[110X  folder. Probably the easiest way to
              do  this if you have received RAMP as a [10X.zip[110X file is to copy the
              file into this location, and then unpack it. After that, you can
              delete the [10X.zip[110X file.[133X
