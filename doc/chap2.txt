  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YAssumptions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are a few assumptions that many methods make.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y1.  The  connection group of a maniplex with N flags is often assumed to act
  on [1..N]. This is gradually being rewritten to allow any set of integers as
  flags, but use caution when working with such connection groups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y2.  When  working  with  a  connection  group  [23X\langle  r_0, \ldots, r_{n-1}
  \rangle[123X,  some  methods  may have strange behavior if any [23Xr_i[123X or [23Xr_i r_j[123X has
  any  fixed  points.  Indeed, Sggis of that type define pre-maniplexes rather
  than  maniplexes.  Eventually, the methods that build maniplexes will verify
  that no [23Xr_i[123X or [23Xr_i r_j[123X has fixed points.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YExtending RAMP[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSuppose  you  want to add a new operation on maniplexes to RAMP. We will see
  how  to  accomplish  that  with  a  hypothetical example. Let's pretend that
  there's a mathematical operation on maniplexes called "Stretch".[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOur  first  step  will  be  to  create  two new files in the lib/ directory:
  stretch.gd  and stretch.gi. The first file is for the declaration of the new
  operation, and the second is for the implementation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  stretch.gd,  we  want  to  add  a  line that declares the new operation,
  something like this:[133X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow we will write the implementation in stretch.gi:[133X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  we  need  to  make sure that these new files are read when RAMP is
  loaded up. Open up init.g (in the root RAMP directory) and add the line[133X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(We  recommend  that you put that line in alphabetical order with the rest.)
  Similarly, open up read.g and add the line[133X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow your code is available in your copy of RAMP![133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  are two more things you should do. First, test your code. Create a new
  file  called  stretch.tst  in  the  tst directory of RAMP. The format of the
  tests  is that you first write a line that starts with "gap> " and continues
  with  some input, as if you actually typed it in to the GAP prompt. Then, on
  the following line, put the expected output.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo run your tests, run the following command in RAMP:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27XTestRamp("stretch.tst");[127X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  any  tests  fail  (that  is,  if  the output from GAP does not match the
  expected  output  from  your  test  file),  then  GAP  will alert you to the
  discrepancies.  Otherwise,  when  the  tests  are complete, there will be no
  output and you will just see the gap> prompt again.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou can also call TEST_RAMP() to run all of the tests in the /tst directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  you  should document your operation! Take a look at one of the .gd
  files  included  with RAMP to see what you should include. To actually build
  the  documentation,  you  will  need  the  package AutoDoc. For example, the
  following will rebuild the documentation:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27XLoadPackage("AutoDoc");[127X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27XAutoDoc("ramp", rec( scaffold := true, autodoc := true));[127X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  see your updated documentation, you can either navigate to the html file
  in  the  doc/  directory,  or you can quit GAP and restart it, and then your
  documentation will be available in the inline help. If you have LaTeX set up
  properly, then it will also build a pdf manual.[133X
