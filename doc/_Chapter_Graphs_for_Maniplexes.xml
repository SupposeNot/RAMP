 <Returns><Code>IsGraph</Code>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Given an edge labeled (multi) graph and a list of labels, it returns connected components of the graph not using edges in the list of labels. Note if the second argument is not used, it is assumed to be an empty list, and the connected components of the original graph are returned.

 Here we see that each connected component of the flag graph of the cube (which has labels 1,2,3) where edges of label 2 are removed, is a 4 cycle.

gamma:=ConnectedComponents(FlagGraph(Cube(3)),[2]);

  <Oper Arg="group" Name="PRGraph" Label="for IsGroup"/>
 <Returns><Code>IsEdgeLabeledGraph </Code>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Given a group, it returns the permutation representation graph for that group. When the group is a string C-group this is also called a CPR graph. The labels of the edges are [1...r] where r is the number of generators of the group.
 </Description>
</ManSection>


 Here we see the CPR graph of the automorphism group of a cube (acting on its 8 vertices).
<Example><![CDATA[
G:=AutomorphismGroup(Cube(3));
H:=Group(G.2,G.3);
phi:=FactorCosetAction(G,H);
G2:=Range(phi);
gamma:=PRGraph(G2);
]]></Example>

 <Description>
Given a a pre-maniplex

 Return the connected derived graph from a pre-maniplex 
 Careful, the order of our automorphisms.  Do we want them on left or right? Does it matter?
 Can make another version with non-connected results, where the group is also an input

 Here we can build the flag graph of a 3-orbit polyhedron.
