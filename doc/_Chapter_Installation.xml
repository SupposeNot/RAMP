 Some quick notes on installation:
<List>
<Item>
RAMP is confirmed to work with version 4.11.1 of GAP, but is known not to work with some earlier versions. 
</Item>
<Item>
Copy the RAMP folder and its contents to your GAP <Code>/pkg</Code> folder.
<List>
<Item>
If using the GAP.app on macOS, this should be your user <Code>Library/Preferences/GAP/pkg</Code> folder. Probably the easiest way to do this if you have received RAMP as a <Code>.zip</Code> file is to copy the file into this location, and then unpack it. After that, you can delete the <Code>.zip</Code> file.
