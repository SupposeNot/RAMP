* Given a non-flat regular polytope P, the quotient Aut(P)/Z(Aut(P)) is a string C-group.
* Same, but quotient by the subgroup generated by any central element.
* The prism over a polyhedron always has a string C connection group. (Note that this is not true of pyramids.) --- We wrote a paper on this.
* Let P be a d-polytope. Prism(P) is C-connected iff P mix Cube(d) is a polytope.
