# RAMP
Research Assistant for Maps and Polytopes
RAMP is a package for working with maps on surfaces, abstract polytopes, and related discrete geometric objects in GAP 4.11.0 or greater. 
More information about GAP is available at https://www.gap-system.org/.
You will need to install the RAMP folder in your GAP package directory to use the included functions, and documentation on all of RAMP's 
features is available through the GAP help system after you have run `LoadPackage("ramp");`.
We recommend adding this command to the end of your `gaprc` file.

The easiest way to access the full documentation once you have loaded RAMP is to type `?ramp:title` into GAP.
