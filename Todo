Below are several things we'd like to eventually add. If you are going to work on one of these and you expect it to take more than a few hours, then write down below what you are working on and/or broadcast in Discord:

Gabe: Documentation and file organization

* Comb / Alg info to add:
	* "Multi-schlafli symbol"? For polyhedra, something like [ [p1, p2, ..., pm], [q1, q2, ..., qk] ] to show all the face-types and vertex-types.
	* "Pseudo-schlafli symbol"? Sometimes we construct something where we know the Schlafli symbol is [p, q] or a proper quotient - it might be useful to store that information somehow, in case computing the SS is hard.
	* Symmetry type graph with respect to a subgroup of the automorphism group
	
* Optimization
	* Generic "IsQuotientOf" function - have it check for compatible sizes etc.
	* Have some way to turn off optimizations in case we want to check an optimization for correctness
	* Make FlatRegularPolyhedra work better. (Better optimized presentations?)

* General constructors
	* Quotient representation -- give a regular polytope and a subgroup of its automorphism group.
	* Add support for working with rotation groups directly
	
* Properties to check for:
	* IsInternallySelfDual
