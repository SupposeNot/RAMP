Below are several things we'd like to eventually add. If you are going to work on one of these and you expect it to take more than a few hours, then write down below what you are working on and/or broadcast in Discord:

Gabe: Documentation and file organization
Mark: DualPolytope for non-regulars


* Polytopes to add:
	* Torus maps (including non-regular!) of type {3,6} to conn.gi. (I have the torus maps of type {4,4} there.)
	* Other maps of type {4, 4}. (e.g. on a Klein bottle, on a cylinder, ...)
	* Cubic toroids
	
* Constructions to add:
	* Truncation of polyhedra
	* Eventually a generic Wythoff operation
	
* Comb / Alg info to add:
	* "Multi-schlafli symbol"? For polyhedra, something like [ [p1, p2, ..., pm], [q1, q2, ..., qk] ] to show all the face-types and vertex-types.
	* "Pseudo-schlafli symbol"? Sometimes we construct something where we know the Schlafli symbol is [p, q] or a proper quotient - it might be useful to store that information somehow, in case computing the SS is hard.
	* Symmetry type graph with respect to a subgroup of the automorphism group
	
* Optimization
	* Generic "IsQuotientOf" function - have it check for compatible sizes etc.
	* Have some way to turn off optimizations in case we want to check an optimization for correctness
	* Make FlatRegularPolyhedra work better. (Better optimized presentations?)

* General constructors
	* Quotient representation -- give a regular polytope and a subgroup of its automorphism group.
	* Add support for working with rotation groups directly
	
* Properties to check for:
	* IsInternallySelfDual
	
* Graphs
	* Skeletons
	* Hasse Diagram
	* Flag graph
	* Layer graphs
